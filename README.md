# Question: Who is statistically the MVP of the league? 

## Project Overview

Every NBA season, there's endless debate around who truly deserves the league’s MVP. Is it the player with the highest plus-minus? The most efficient scorer? The one with the most win shares? Or is it some combination of all of the above? The term “valuable” is subjective—it can mean individual dominance, team success, on/off-court impact, or something else entirely. Rather than rely on analyst opinions or fan voting (which often favors players from larger markets), I built a composite MVP score using advanced statistics to determine who the true statistical MVP of the league is.
